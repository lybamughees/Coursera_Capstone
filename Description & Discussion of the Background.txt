1. Description & Discussion of the Background

Road accidents are very common for most drivers. A lot of the times, these road accidents aren't that severe or life threatening. Over the past few years, 
the number of road accidents have been increasing with a higher number of road accidents over the past few years. This is having a negative impact on the 
society since the cost of the injuries is increasing. About 1.35 million people die in road crashes worldwide annually. On top of the deaths, about 50
million people suffer serious but non-life threatening injuries from road crashes each year. These numbers are very infortunate and high. On top of the 
injuries, it costs the government 10.7 billion dollars in medical costs for accidents.This is a huge concern for the society and there needs to be 
a way to reduce this cost.
